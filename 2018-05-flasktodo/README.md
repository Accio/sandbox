A simple to-do list for the family, using Flask
===

In the last two days, I build a mini web site to serve as a to-do list for the family using Flask. The website has essentially the same functionality as the *flaskr* blog illustrated by the Flask tutorial. However, in order to make sure that I understand the concepts, I made it into a to-do-list tool.
