An running example of BatchJobs in R
====================================

The example file __testBatchJobs.R__ runs on rbalhpc05, the head of clusters where Torque/PBS is installed.

zhangj83-rbalhpc05.tmpl, the template file digested by the brew package, is slighly modified from the [template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs/master/examples/cfTorque/simple.tmpl).
